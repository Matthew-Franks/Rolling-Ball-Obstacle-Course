# Rolling-Ball-Obstacle-Course

This was my first project on Unity.

The game is heavily inspired from the notorious Roll-A-Ball beginner tutorial for Unity. Essentially, I wanted to play around with it and see what I could do.

There are currently seven levels, although I intend to add three more eventually. The levels offer the following attributes:
* Bouncy Platforms
* Moving Platforms
* Falling Platforms
* Extremely Bouncy Horizontal Platforms
* Revolving Platforms
